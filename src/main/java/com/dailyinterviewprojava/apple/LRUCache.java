 * LRU cache is a cache data structure that has limited space, and once there are more items in the cache than available space, 
 * it will preempt the least recently used item. What counts as recently used is any item a key has 'get' or 'put' called on it.
 * 
 * Implement an LRU cache class with the 2 functions 'put' and 'get'. 'put' should place a value mapped to a certain key, 
 * and preempt items if needed. 'get' should return the value for a given key if it exists in the cache, and return None if it doesn't exist.
