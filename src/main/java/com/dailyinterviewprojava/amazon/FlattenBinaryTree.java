 * Given a binary tree, flatten the binary tree using inorder traversal. 
 * Instead of creating a new list, reuse the nodes, where the list is represented by following each right child. 
 * As such the root should always be the first element in the list so you do not need to return anything in the implementation, 
 * just rearrange the nodes such that following the right child will give us the list.
