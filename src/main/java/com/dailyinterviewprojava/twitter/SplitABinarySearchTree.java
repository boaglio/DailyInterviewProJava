 * Given a binary search tree (BST) and a value s, split the BST into 2 trees, where one tree has all values less than or equal to s, and the other tree has all values greater than s while maintaining the tree structure of the original BST. 
 * You can assume that s will be one of the node's value in the BST. Return both tree's root node as a tuple.
