 * Given a list of meetings that will happen during a day, find the minimum number of meeting rooms that can fit all meetings.
 * 
 * Each meeting will be represented by a tuple of (start_time, end_time), where both start_time and end_time will be represented by an integer to indicate the time. 
 * start_time will be inclusive, and end_time will be exclusive, meaning a meeting of (0, 10) and (10, 20) will only require 1 meeting room.
