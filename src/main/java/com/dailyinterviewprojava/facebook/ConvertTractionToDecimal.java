 * Given a numerator and a denominator, find what the equivalent decimal representation is as a string. 
 * If the decimal representation has recurring digits, then put those digits in brackets (ie 4/3 should be represented by 1.(3) to represent 1.333...). 
 * Do not use any built in evaluator functions like python's eval. You can also assume that the denominator will be nonzero.
