 * Kaprekar's Constant is the number 6174. This number is special because it has the property where for any 4-digit number that has 2 or more unique digits, if you repeatedly apply a certain function it always reaches the number 6174.
 * 
 * This certain function is as follows:
 * - Order the number in ascending form and descending form to create 2 numbers.
 * - Pad the descending number with zeros until it is 4 digits in length.
 * - Subtract the ascending number from the descending number.
 * - Repeat.
