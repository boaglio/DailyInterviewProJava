 * Given an expression (as a list) in reverse polish notation, evaluate the expression. 
 * Reverse polish notation is where the numbers come before the operand. 
 * Note that there can be the 4 operands '+', '-', '*', '/'. You can also assume the expression will be well formed.
 * 
 * Example
 * Input: [1, 2, 3, '+', 2, '*', '-']
 * Output: -9
 * The equivalent expression of the above reverse polish notation would be (1 - ((2 + 3) * 2)).
