 * Reshaping a matrix means to take the same elements in a matrix but change the row and column length. 
 * This means that the new matrix needs to have the same elements filled in the same row order as the old matrix. 
 * Given a matrix, a new row size x and a new column size y, reshape the matrix. If it is not possible to reshape, return None.
